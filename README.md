## Technical Skills
- **Languages:** C++, C, Python,java, javascript
- **Web Development:** Node.js, React, Redux, Express, MongoDB and Firebase
- **Verilog Development:** Proficient in tackling complex digital design challenges
## Academics
I graduated with an impressive CGPA of 9.41 ranking 4th in my department. I have also qualified GATE EC 2024 with a rank of 2162.
## Power Converter Design Expertise
Throughout my academic journey, I've gained valuable insights into converter topologies, control techniques, and semiconductor devices. My meticulous research and testing approach have equipped me with a deep understanding of power electronics, enabling me to deliver optimal solutions that meet industry standards.

## Web Development Enthusiast
Alongside my electrical engineering specialization, I've developed a keen interest in web development. Currently, I am a full-stack developer proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This expertise allows me to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, design RESTful APIs, and deploy scalable web applications.

## Projects

### Power Converter Design
1. **Reduced Stress Cubic Boost DC-DC Converter**
   - Achieves a normalized voltage gain of 1.375, 37.5% more efficient than conventional structures
   - Operates at 50kHz, handling an input range of 18V-400V
   - Real-time control and monitoring web application using React.js

### Web Development
1. **Cubic DC-DC  Boost Converter: Real-Time Control and Monitoring with XLR8-Hub**
Xelerate Hub (FrontEnd):
Utilized ReactJS and ReCharts for real-time data visualization and control. Achieved resolutions down to 10ms with advanced outlier detection. Dynamic control panel for parameter adjustments.
Backend (Express Server and Websocket Server):
Express server managing communication between FrontEnd and STM32. Websocket server for efficient data dispatch. Serial monitor parser for real-time data transmission. It also handles HTTP requests from the front-end to change parameters and resolution.
STM32 Microcontroller:
Generates  PWM signals for RS-CBC in four modes including open loop and closed loop. Real-time parameter adjustments from FrontEnd. ADC readings for continuous monitoring of output voltage and current.
Power Converter (RS-C3BC):
(16-32V) input,400V 200W output. Exceptional gain-to-component ratio. Reduced current stress on inductors. Voltage Amplification of 22 at duty ratio of 0.5.
