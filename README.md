With a focus on power converter design, I have successfully developed and tested high-gain DC-DC converters, optimizing power transfer and achieving impressive voltage gains. My proficiency in Verilog enables me to tackle complex digital design challenges with confidence, ensuring efficient and reliable performance.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable insights into converter topologies, control techniques, and semiconductor devices. My meticulous research and testing approach have equipped me with a deep understanding of power electronics, enabling me to deliver optimal solutions that meet industry standards.

In addition to my electrical engineering specialization, I have a growing interest in web development. I am skilled in full-stack web development using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I leverage this expertise to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, design RESTful APIs, and deploy scalable web applications.
